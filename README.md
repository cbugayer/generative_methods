## What do you want the user to feel when using these tools? What mood is this for? What is the user trying to do?

For the snake I want the user to feel like they're playing snake. 
The mood of the raining money should make the user feel rich. 
The other two brushes are supposed to show that user that they can create art with just a few lines.



## Describe your eraser. What does it do? 
It draws grey, the color of the canvas, on top of anything drawn.
The size is controlled by the slider.


## Describe your 1st tool. What does it do? How is it used?
The snake creates eel-like snakes that pop off the screen. 
The color of the snake and its outline are controlled by the user. 
I crafted the face of the snake for when it moves left, right, or straight, using triangles and circles.

## Describe your 2nd tool. What does it do? How is it used?
This tool chaotically draws inward bezier curves.
So although it gives curvey vibes, it can make use of sharp edges to create a contrasting artwork.
It is great for drawing tangled slinkies.


## Describe your 3rd tool. What does it do? How is it used?
This tool makes money rain from wherever the user clicks. 
It draws cnavas-colored circles behind each bill to give the impression of falling.
Sometimes extra money falls as a bonus.


## Describe your 4th tool. What does it do? How is it used?
This tool uses symmetry to create parallel webs of multiple colors. 
The alternating colors can cause a seizure if used inappropriately.

## Which of your tools is continuous? What makes that different?

My snake is continuous, as a snake should be. 
The scales of the outline aren't as continuous to give more of a scaley feeling.


## Which of your tools uses begin/endshape? What are you doing with that feature?

My bezier curve tool uses begin/endshape. It makes distinct curvy shapes.
